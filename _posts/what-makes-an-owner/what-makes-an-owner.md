The start-up world is an ecosystem, and due to its main features, it can be very appealing for those personalities inclined to entrepreneurship at different levels. You don’t need to be a founder or a start-up CEO to seek a sense of ownership and feel you are contributing to growing and launching something that could have a significant impact.

### In this article we will approach to the characteristics of an ownership mentality that can be a match to start-ups environments and influence positively in such fast-moving workplaces.

For those unfamiliar with start-ups, this is a particular business environment with its dynamics. For more information, you can check this article to get an overall idea. [https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-a-startup/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-a-startup/)

The life of a start-up is like a marathon with many sprint stages. A company is ****a living organism with its different growth stages and needs.  

There is a lot of diversity and autonomy, which demands excellent coordination and cohesion to implement natural interdependence. This is a perfect environment for those with an entrepreneurial mindset and the ones who like working in teams.

As a team member involved in the hiring process, I meet many people with different level of technical capabilities and soft skills. 

Ownership is not exclusive to the start-up environment. Still, it is sure that at the beginning of any start-up, a high sense of ownership is a very desirable attitude or skill. Some people have almost integrated “ownership” as one leading quality of their personality, but it can also be enforced and developed through time. 

Many who work in start-ups, especially during the first stages, have **experience in entrepreneurship or a preference for it**.  For example, it is a usual practice for some start-ups to search actively for hires who have been previously founders:

The entrepreneur mindset is related to, at least, a certain sense of ownership. 

### **So, what makes an owner?**

It is not only about “owning something”  (I mean, most of the employees in a start-up are also stakeholders) but more about actively contributing to the creature's growth: taking care of it in many aspects and actively working for its best.  Here are some characteristics that may help to understand what ownership means and how it relates to company life:

Owners **get involved.** They want to know about the company's path in all aspects. They want to know what is being done, planned, and achieved. What are the projected goals in time? They contribute to reaching milestones by taking responsibility for what can be done from their perspectives in their roles and field. They understand the company's vision and make analyses and contributions with ideas and feedback for a continuous improvement of the whole.

Owners **align.** We need to sync continuously to ensure that we share points of view with our teammates to get the best of our shared perspective and agree on the steps we individually can take to get where we want to get. We must be open to feedback during alignment and dare to share feedback with our mates. Sincere input from the heart will not please our egos or the other one sometimes, but it is critical to build and support a healthy company.

Owners **seek context and knowledge**. For example, technical owners usually need to understand and like the product or project and believe in the impact that may affect users. Owners whose role relates to other areas of the company must at least enjoy their contribution to the team and the global aspects of the project. We are talking about doing what we love and loving what we do.

Owners have a certain level of **tolerance for uncertainty.**  According to different aspects, this is a business based on venture capital, and it may succeed or not. It depends on many factors that would not rely on us. That is why staying calm, focused, and happy about the role and the project contributes to the strength of an adventurous mindset.  On the other hand, start-ups go into the unknown and are continuously dynamic, so the mind that finds solutions must be creative and willing to explore.

Owners are **resilient.** In time, this can become “fortitude,” a desirable superpower where we can activate our best version during adversity. Owners don’t take failure too seriously to surrender, but they take it seriously enough to embrace it and learn from it.

Owners have **accountability.** Each can create an impact in their organizations and take the responsibility of doing so through their performance, success, and failures. When we healthily approach auto criticism, growth is guaranteed. That is one of the most direct ways to interdependence and reach the best version of ourselves.

Owners have **a team vision.** They contribute to the whole. And know that they are serving themselves by serving others. That also means transcending individuality and contributing to company culture, relations, shared experiences, and visions to grow. It also means making decisions by taking into account a large image. This is related to the concept of Ownership that Kaspar L. mentions in his article “Ownership and responsibility in software development teams.” [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ownership-responsibility-software-development-teams-kaspar-lyngsie/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ownership-responsibility-software-development-teams-kaspar-lyngsie/) It is defined as “taking the initiative to solve a task in the way you, as a team, believe is best.”

These reflections can be a clue to check if we are activating all this sense and attitude around ownership and trying to motivate this in others.

But I would like to add something else, which is quite intuitive and robust: **we could ask ourselves, “When do I feel like an owner?” and identify the feeling around those moments, as well as what triggers that part of our personality.**

I find myself in the “ownership mode” when I see asking myself: “What needs to be done?” in a natural, spontaneous way. At that moment, I feel my willingness opens some energy flow to me to gain focus, creativity, and responsiveness. It reminds me of a definition of “discipline” by Sadhguru. This very grounded Indian spiritual master says discipline is nothing rigid but doing what needs to be done in every situation. Ownership has to do a lot with influencing our reality by being in charge and responding from the inside to what is presented to us. 

In the next series of these articles, we will review what steps we have taken at Wasmer towards generating an ownership attitude within the team. Stay tuned for updates!
